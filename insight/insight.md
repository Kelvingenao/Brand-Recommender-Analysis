# Marketing Strategy Based on Recommendation Analysis and Purchase Behavior

## üéØ Strategy Objective

Design a general strategy based on key findings regarding consumer behavior and recommendation probability, to serve as a guide for brands aiming to optimize sales and customer experience on both holidays and non-holidays. This strategy can be adapted by internal data analytics teams based on the specific goals of each brand.

## üìä Key Findings from the Analysis

### üîù Brands with the Highest Recommendation Probability (1.0)

#### On holidays:
- Godrej Interio  
- Manyavar Mohey  
- Allen Solly Woman (0.9)  
- Dettol  

#### On non-holidays:
- Pepe Jeans London  
- Lee Cooper (0.5)  
- AmazonBasics (0.4)  

### üë©‚Äçü¶∞üë® Gender Differences (Average Recommendation)

| Day Type       | Female   | Male     |
|----------------|----------|----------|
| Overall        | 0.63125  | 0.72944  |
| Holidays       | 0.60298  | 0.70658  |
| Non-Holidays   | 0.65167  | 0.74489  |

üîé Although men show higher recommendation probability, research shows that **women tend to make more purchases than men**. This could indicate a **suboptimal shopping experience** for the female segment in this specific case.

## üìå Proposed General Strategy

### 1. Optimizing Non-Holiday Strategies

- Brands that perform better on holidays can **replicate festive strategies on regular days** (discounts, gifts, bundles).
- Example: Godrej Interio, Dettol, and Manyavar Mohey could launch micro-campaigns on regular Mondays or Wednesdays using their winning formula.

### 2. Gender-Based Segmentation

Although men have a higher recommendation rate, **women generally make more purchases**.  
Brands should:

- Improve the female experience: personalized service, more attractive in-store spaces, better website usability, gender-specific campaigns.
- Include loyalty programs with emotional appeal and exclusive benefits.

### 3. Customer Experience and Brand Activation

For brands like Lee Cooper or AmazonBasics, which have **lower recommendation rates on holidays**, it is recommended to:

- Launch **specific campaigns for holidays**: bundles, online events, gamification, VIP benefits.
- Make UX, messaging, and segmentation adjustments targeting women, who might be less satisfied with the current experience.

---

## üß© Next Steps for Brands

- Internally validate with analytics teams whether this data aligns with their own reports.
- Segment loyal customers by gender and day type to run A/B tests for campaign performance.
- Investigate causes of lower female satisfaction (feedback, surveys, UX analysis).
- Monitor the evolution of recommendation probability after implementing improvements.

## ‚úÖ Final Notes

> This strategy is a general starting point. With more data (e.g., age, region, sales channel, etc.), much more specific recommendations could be made based on customer clusters or profiles.

## ‚ÑπÔ∏è Fun Fact

**Is it true that women shop more than men?**  
Yes. On average, **women tend to make more frequent purchases for fashion, health, home, and beauty**, while men usually spend more on technology and high-ticket items. However, this always depends on context, target audience, and product type.
